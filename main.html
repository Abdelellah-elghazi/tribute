           <h2>william shakespeare</h2>
           <p>was an English poet, playwright, and actor. He was born on 26 April 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon.
            <br> His father was a successful local businessman and his mother was the daughter of a landowner.
            <br> Shakespeare is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist.
            <br> He is often called England's national poet and nicknamed the Bard of Avon. He wrote about 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, of which the authorship of some is uncertain.<br> His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.</p>
           <h3>His work</h3>
           <p>Shakespeare produced most of his known work between 1589 and 1613.<br> His early plays were mainly comedies and histories and these works remain regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres. He then wrote mainly tragedies until about 1608, including Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, considered some of the finest works in the English language.<br> In his last phase, he wrote tragicomedies, also known as romances, and collaborated with other playwrights.

            Shakespeare's plays remain highly popular today and are constantly studied, performed, and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts throughout the world.</p>
